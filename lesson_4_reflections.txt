When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- When collaborating with other people or when working from multiple places. This gives access to all files from anywhere in the world to anyone I'm woking with.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- In case I'm working on some function that is not related to the added function, it might cause bugs before it is complete.
